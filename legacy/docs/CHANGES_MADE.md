All changes made to prepare the codebase for Colab execution.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `main.py`

**Line 43-46: Updated cache directory paths**
```python
# OLD:
cache_dir = '/mnt/data/sanchit/hf'
os.environ['HF_HUB_CACHE'] = '/mnt/data/sanchit/hf'

# NEW:
cache_dir = '/content/hf_cache'
os.environ['HF_HUB_CACHE'] = '/content/hf_cache'
os.environ['TRANSFORMERS_CACHE']= '/content/hf_cache'
os.environ['HF_HOME'] = '/content/hf_cache'
```

**Lines 210-242: Updated checkpoint loading for evaluation**
```python
# OLD: Hardcoded cluster paths
grpo_path = "/mnt/home/sanchit/rl-chart/grpo-start-ckpts/..."

# NEW: Auto-detect local or download from HuggingFace
if args.grpo_lora:
    from peft import PeftModel
    # Checks for local checkpoint first
    # Falls back to HuggingFace download if not found
```

**Lines 529-585: Complete replacement of GRPO dataset loading**
```python
# OLD: Complex multi-path logic loading from JSON files
# - Relied on local rationale files
# - Multiple conditional branches
# - Hard to debug

# NEW: Simple, clean HuggingFace dataset loading
# - Loads from sanchit97/chart-rvr-grpo-train
# - Auto-downloads if not cached
# - Clear logging
# - Easy to debug
```

---

### 2. `dataset_process.py`

**Lines 40-43: Updated cache directory paths**
```python
# OLD:
cache_dir = '/mnt/data/sanchit/hf'

# NEW:
cache_dir = '/content/hf_cache'
os.environ['HF_HUB_CACHE'] = '/content/hf_cache'
os.environ['TRANSFORMERS_CACHE']= '/content/hf_cache'
os.environ['HF_HOME'] = '/content/hf_cache'
```

---

### 3. `deepspeed_zero3.yaml`

**Line 16: Changed num_processes for single GPU**
```yaml
# OLD:
num_processes: 2  # For 2 GPUs

# NEW:
num_processes: 1  # For single A100
```

---

### 4. `requirements.txt`

**Line 204: Fixed broken TRL path**
```python
# OLD:
trl @ file:///mnt/home/sanchit/rl-chart/trl  # Local path - won't work

# NEW:
trl==0.12.0  # Install from PyPI
```

---

## Files Created

### 1. `COLAB_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`
Pure execution guide with zero explanations - just copy-paste commands in sequence.

**Sections:**
- Part 1: Setup (15-20 min)
- Part 2: Download Dataset (15-30 min)
- Part 3: GRPO Training (12-16 hours)
- Part 4: Evaluation (4-6 hours)
- Part 5: Results Summary
- Alternative: Pre-trained models
- Troubleshooting Quick Reference

**Target user:** Someone who wants to run commands without reading documentation.

---

### 2. `verify_setup.py`
Pre-training verification script that checks:
- ✓ GPU availability (A100, 40GB)
- ✓ All dependencies installed
- ✓ Code modifications applied correctly
- ✓ Dataset downloaded
- ✓ Disk space available (≥50GB)
- ✓ HuggingFace authentication

**Usage:**
```bash
python verify_setup.py
```

**Output:** Pass/fail for each check with fix instructions.

---

### 3. `REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` (Updated)
Comprehensive guide with explanations, background, and troubleshooting.

---

## What These Changes Achieve

### Before Changes:
❌ Hardcoded cluster paths (`/mnt/data/sanchit/...`)
❌ Required manual dataset generation with 72B model
❌ Complex dataset loading logic
❌ Unclear how to use in Colab
❌ Difficult to debug

### After Changes:
✅ Colab-compatible paths (`/content/hf_cache`)
✅ Auto-downloads pre-generated dataset from HuggingFace
✅ Simple, linear dataset loading
✅ Clear execution guide
✅ Easy to debug with logging
✅ Auto-detects checkpoints or downloads from HF

---

## How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Start (No Reading)
```bash
# In Colab:
!git clone https://github.com/sanchit97/chartrl.git
%cd chartrl

# Follow COLAB_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md step by step
```

### Option 2: With Verification
```bash
# After setup in Part 1 of guide:
!python verify_setup.py

# If all checks pass, proceed with training
```

### Option 3: Understand Everything First
```bash
# Read REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md
# Then follow execution steps
```

## Testing Checklist

Before pushing changes, verify:

- [ ] `grep "/content/hf_cache" main.py` shows updated paths
- [ ] `grep "/content/hf_cache" dataset_process.py` shows updated paths
- [ ] `grep "num_processes: 1" deepspeed_zero3.yaml` shows single GPU
- [ ] `verify_setup.py` runs without errors
- [ ] Dataset can be downloaded: `load_dataset("sanchit97/chart-rvr-grpo-train")`
- [ ] Training starts without dataset errors

## Unchanged (Core Methodology)

The following were **NOT modified** to preserve paper reproducibility:

✓ Reward functions in `grpo_utils.py`
✓ GRPO hyperparameters (4 epochs, 4 rollouts, batch size 2)
✓ Process conformity reward design
✓ Surrogate task rewards (chart type, table)
✓ Output format structure
✓ Model architecture (Qwen2.5-VL-3B)
✓ Training algorithm (GRPO with relative advantages)

## Git Commit Message (Suggested)

```
feat: Add Colab compatibility and execution guide

- Update cache paths from cluster to Colab (/content/hf_cache)
- Replace complex dataset loading with HuggingFace integration
- Auto-download sanchit97/chart-rvr-grpo-train dataset
- Add checkpoint auto-detection and HF fallback
- Create execution-focused guide (COLAB_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md)
- Add pre-training verification script (verify_setup.py)
- Update deepspeed config for single A100 GPU

Changes preserve core methodology for reproducibility.
No modifications to reward functions or training algorithm.
