"""
Cross-Level Coherence (CLC) Reward.

This is a core contribution of the thesis. CLC verifies that the reasoning
actually references values from the extracted table, catching "hallucinated
reasoning" where models produce correct answers via fabricated intermediate steps.

Example of hallucinated reasoning:
    Extracted table: {2020: 100, 2021: 150}
    Reasoning: "The values are 80 and 170, so 80+170 = 250"
    Answer: 250 (correct, but reasoning uses fabricated values!)

CLC catches this by checking:
    C_coherence = |values_in_reasoning ∩ values_in_table| / |values_in_reasoning|
